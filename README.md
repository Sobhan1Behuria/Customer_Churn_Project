# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using a machine learning approach. Customer churn refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with an organization. By predicting churn, businesses can implement strategies to retain their customers and optimize operations.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- **Data Balancing:** The dataset is balanced using the `SMOTEENN` technique to handle class imbalance.
- **Model Building:** Random Forest model is used to classify customers into churn and non-churn categories.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess model performance.
- **Visualizations:** Important plots for exploratory data analysis and model insights.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn


## Results
The Random Forest model achieved a high accuracy with well-balanced metrics after handling class imbalance using SMOTEENN. The visualizations helped identify the key factors contributing to customer churn, enabling effective decision-making.
